This repository has an web application 'dashboard'. <br><br>
This application now incorporates the data analyzing step when retrieving data to display. The data is about population in South Korea or in Seoul obtained from the goverment public data. 
The analysis includes, for exmaple, 'Number of Population under Age 5 in Seoul in 2020', 'Population Difference between 2018 and 2020 in Seoul' and so on. <br><br>
I analyzed the data only with `python` and `numpy`, not `pandas`.
> This app is made with `Django`, `Bootstrap`, `python`, `html`, `javascript`, `jQuery`, `ajax`.
